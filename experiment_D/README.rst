Experiment D - Moving Peaks Benchmark
===================================================

Description
-----------

This approach will not only helps us explore the metrics theoretically but also reveals their behavior with in practical algorithms. We have selected the `Moving Peaks Benchmark (MPB) <https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/api/benchmarks.html#module-deap.benchmarks.movingpeaks>`_ as our testing ground. The choice is due to its ability to finely control various problem characteristics, including the number of optima, their positions, dimensions, height, and more.

The MPB offers three predefined scenarios, and throughout our experiments, we will thoroughly investigate each one. This entails subjecting the metrics to testing under these three distinct scenarios.
