Experiment C - Moving Peaks Benchmark
===================================================

Description
-----------

In these final experiments, we put the metrics to the test in real optimization processes, providing insights into their practical performance alongside actual algorithms. This approach not only helps us explore the metrics theoretically but also reveals their behavior in practical optimization scenarios. To conduct these experiments, we have selected the `Moving Peaks Benchmark (MPB) <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/785502>`_  as our testing ground. We chose the MPB due to its ability to finely control various problem characteristics, including the number of optima, their positions, dimensions, height, and more.

The MPB offers three predefined scenarios, and throughout our experiments, we will thoroughly investigate each one. This entails subjecting the metrics to testing under these three distinct scenarios.
